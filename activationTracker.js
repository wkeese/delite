/**
 * Tracks which nodes are currently "active".
 * A node is considered active if it or a descendant node has focus,
 * or if a non-focusable descendant was the most recent node
 * to get a touchstart/mousedown/pointerdown event.
 *
 * Emits non-bubbling `delite-activated` and `delite-deactivated` events on nodes
 * as they become active, or stop being active, as defined above.
 *
 * Call `activationTracker.on("active-stack", callback)` to track the stack of currently active nodes.
 *
 * Call `activationTracker.on("deactivated", func)` or `activationTracker.on("activated", ...)` to monitor when
 * when nodes become active/inactive.
 *
 * ActivationTracker also provides infrastructure for opening/closing popups merely by hovering/unhovering
 * a button.  Emits `delite-hover-activated` event on nodes that are hovered for `hoverDelay`
 * milliseconds, and emits `delite-hover-deactivated` event after a node
 * and its descendants (ex: DropDownButton's descendant is a Tooltip)
 * have been unhovered for `hoverDelay` milliseconds.  If the user unhovers a node and then re-hovers within
 * `hoverDelay` milliseconds, there's no `delite-hover-deactivated` event.
 *
 * TO IMPLEMENT: Generally, there is a delay between hovering a node and the "delite-hover-activated" event,
 * If the user hovers a node and then unhovers within the delay, there's no "delite-hover-activated"
 * event.  However, clicking a node sends the "delite-hover-activated" event to it (and its ancestors)
 * immediately.
 *
 * TO IMPLEMENT: Clicking a blank area of the screen will cause immediate delite-hover-deactivated events
 * for nodes with timers running.  Likewise for keyboard click.
 *
 * TO IMPLEMENT: Similarly, the delay is also waived if there is already a popup open and then the user hovers
 * another button that shows a popup on hover.  To achieve this, all nodes that show a popup
 * on the "delite-hover-activated" event must be marked with the attribute "hover-shows-popup".
 * TODO: How to tell if another popup is opened?  It might have been opened by clicking rather than
 * by hover.  Or do we care about that case?
 *
 * TO IMPLEMENT: Remember whether it opened due to a hover event or a click event.  If it opened
 * due to a click event then it shouldn't close until another click.
